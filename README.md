One of the "Boss Level" challenges from Angela Yu's 2022 Web Development Bootcamp (Udemy).

The purpose of this project was to practice JavaScript and jQuery. I was able to find the resources for the JS and jQuery by consulting Stack Overflow and Google. 
I was able to figure out quite a bit of this one independently, though there were times when I wound up consulting the tutorials. I also refactored quite a bit as I went.
I left parts of my old code as pseudocode to reflect my thought processes as I was puzzling through this one. Overall, I had a lot of fun.

The one thing is, I created three gameOver functions, which was probably the long (if easier) way to call the functions. Maybe I should've refactored. But I really
wanted to push the project to Github for my portfolio, and hey, it works! 

I most likely am not going to deploy this project, as it's not a full stack project, so if you want to see and play the game, here's the App Brewery version: https://londonappbrewery.github.io/Simon-Game/
